Web Scraping Odyssey: Craigslist & The Old Reader Exploration

Introduction

Welcome to my personal project repository, where I share my adventure into the realm of web scraping and automation using Python. This project is a deep dive into extracting valuable information from the web, focusing on the "free" section of Craigslist in the San Francisco Bay Area and automating the login process for The Old Reader. It's a journey of learning, exploration, and application of Python skills in real-world scenarios.
